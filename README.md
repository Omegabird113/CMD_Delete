# CMD + Delete
In Minecraft on MacOS, pressing `option` and `backspace` deletes a single character, and pressing `command` and `backspace` deletes a word. **This is completely inconsistent with the native OS**, so I fixed it:
## Important Context
1. As of right now, **this only works in some places**. This includes chat and the Creative Menu search. It does not includem Signs or Books.
2. If you use this mod **on Windows** (or Linux), **nothing should change** from the Vinilla behavor
3. If you have any problems with this mod, **please report them as Issues on GitHUb**.
## All the Mew Key Combinations
- `option` + `backspace` (`control` + `backspace` on Windows): deletes previous word
- `command` + backspace (no Windows equivalant): deletes all of line previous to cursor
- `option` + any arrow key (`control` + any arrow key on Windows): moves to one word in the direction of the arrow
- `command` + any arrow key (no Windows equivalant): moves to the start/end of the line in the direction of the arrow
- `option` + `shift` + any arrow key (`control` + `shift` + any arrow key on Windows): moves to & selects one word in the direction of the arrow
- `command` + `shift` + any arrow key (no Windows equivalant): moves to & selects the start/end of the line in the direction of the arrow
